# Community Opportunity Index

[Internal Map](https://pwccoi.streamlit.app/) can be accessed here!

## Overview
We use external data sources, including [EPA Smart Location](https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping), [SVI](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/svi-data-documentation-download.html), [Virginia Department of Transportation](https://www.virginiaroads.org/maps/1a96a2f31b4f4d77991471b6cabb38ba/about) and [ACS datasets](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) and internal data source, which is the **Fire&EMS Call data**. These sources provide Census tract-level variables that contribute to the final creation of the Community Opportunity Index. We selected variables that would be relevant, and we cleaned and transformed the data to ensure its quality.

## Data Dictionary

This document provides detailed information about the variables in the [`NSI_0902_OFFICIAL.csv`](https://github.com/LSAPLab/CommunityOpportunityIndex/blob/main/Final_Datasets/NSI_0902_OFFICIAL.csv) dataset, including their names, descriptions, data sources and category. The dataset includes **92** unique Census tract IDs. We excluded 9801 since there are no residences in that tract.

## Data Transformation Methods

1. **E_UNINSUR_P**

   The SVI dataset contains two variables: `E_UNINSUR` (total number of uninsured individuals) and `E_TOTPOP` (total civilian noninstitutionalized population). To calculate the percentage of uninsured individuals, the formula **E_UNINSUR / E_TOTPOP** is applied.

2. **E_HBURD_P**

   The SVI dataset contains two variables: `E_HBURD` (housing cost-burdened occupied housing units with annual income less than $75,000) and `E_HH` (total number of households). The percentage of housing cost-burdened units is calculated using the formula **E_HBURD / E_HH**.

3. **E_SNGPNT_P**

   To calculate the percentage of single-parent households with children under 18, the formula **E_SNGPNT / E_HH** is used. Here, `E_SNGPNT` represents the number of single-parent households, and `E_HH` is the total number of households.

4. **E_MUNIT_P**

   The percentage of housing in structures with 10 or more units is derived using **E_MUNIT / E_HU**, where `E_MUNIT` represents the number of multi-unit housing structures, and `E_HU` is the total number of housing units.

5. **E_MOBILE_P**

   To compute the percentage of mobile homes, the formula **E_MOBILE / E_HU** is applied. Here, `E_MOBILE` is the number of mobile homes, and `E_HU` is the total number of housing units.

6. **E_CROWD_P**

   The percentage of overcrowded households is calculated as **E_CROWD / E_HH**, where `E_CROWD` represents households with more people than rooms, and `E_HH` is the total number of households.

7. **E_NOVEH_P**

   The percentage of households without vehicle availability is determined using **E_NOVEH / E_HH**, where `E_NOVEH` is the number of households without vehicles, and `E_HH` is the total number of households.

8. **E_GROUPQ_P**

   The percentage of individuals living in group quarters is computed as **E_GROUPQ / E_TOTPOP**, where `E_GROUPQ` represents the number of individuals in group quarters, and `E_TOTPOP` is the total population.

9. **With_Medicaid_P**

   The percentage of individuals covered by Medicaid is calculated as **Medicaid / Total Population**, using data from ACS datasets.

10. **Work_Drivealone_P**

    The percentage of individuals driving alone to work is derived as **Drive Alone / Total Workers**, using data from ACS "Mode of Transportation to Work".

11. **Work_Carpooled_P**

    The percentage of individuals carpooling to work is computed as **Carpooled / Total Workers**, using data from ACS "Mode of Transportation to Work".

12. **Work_PublicTransportation_P**

    To determine the percentage of individuals taking public transportation to work, the formula **Public Transportation / Total Workers** is used, sourced from ACS datasets.

13. **Work_Walk_P**

    The percentage of individuals walking to work is derived as **Walk / Total Workers**, sourced from ACS "Mode of Transportation to Work".

14. **Work_Taximotorbike_P**

    The percentage of individuals using taxi, motorbike, or bicycle to work is calculated as **Taxi, Motorbike, or Bicycle / Total Workers**, using ACS datasets.

15. **Work_Fromhome_P**

    The percentage of individuals working from home is computed as **Work from Home / Total Workers**, sourced from ACS datasets.

16. **With_PublicAssIncome_P**

    The percentage of individuals receiving public assistance or SNAP benefits is derived as **Public Assistance Income / Total Population**, sourced from ACS "SNAP".

17. **With_SSI_P**

    The percentage of individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is calculated as **SSI / Total Population**, using data from ACS datasets.

18. **Mean_Transportation_time(min)**

    The average commute time is calculated using the mean values for each time period band in ACS "Travel Time to Work". For example, a band of 20-24 minutes is approximated as **(20 + 24) / 2 = 22.5** minutes. For the maximum band (>90 minutes), a value of 100 is used for estimation.

19. **Mean_Proportion_HHIncome**

    The average proportion of household income spent on housing costs is derived by calculating the midpoint for each percentage band in ACS "Housing Costs". For example, a band of 10-14.9% is approximated as **(10 + 14.9) / 2 = 12.45%**. For the highest band (>50%), 60% is used for estimation.

20. **Owner_occupied_P**

    The percentage of housing units that are owner-occupied is calculated as **Owner-Occupied / Total Housing Units**, sourced from ACS "B25008".
